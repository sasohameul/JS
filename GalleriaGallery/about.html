            <h2>A Long Look at the<br /> GALLERIAGALLERY</h2>
            <p> The most remarkable feature of Maria Svarbova's artwork is her ability to create astonishing harmony
                through the appropriate combination of old and new elements. Svarbova delicately balances between the
                new and the old, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in her works. This interaction between the
                new and the old has served as a valuable reference for constructing the exhibition titled "FUTURO
                RETRO," <br />which explores the concept of "yesterday's future."</p>
        </div>


        <div class="history_img1">
            <img class="history_description" src="img/history_img01.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="history_description">Maria's unique style focuses on experimentation with space, color, and
                atmosphere, breaking away from traditional portraiture. With an interest in architecture and public
                spaces from the era of socialism, Maria transforms each scene with her creative palette, emphasizing the
                range and depth of her modern freshness. The meticulous composition of figures and ordinary objects
                creates thematic and dreamlike scenes. Her images maintain a quiet tension that hints at new
                possibilities within the clean and smooth rhythm of the surface.

                Maria's postmodern vision boldly expresses a dialogue that compels viewers to respond to the mysteries,
                loneliness, and isolation of the human experience. Nevertheless, her style, deeply rooted in subdued
                pastel tones, offers a way for the viewer's gaze to continually transform the humble beauty of life into
                a state of perpetual reverence.

                    Alex Stoddard (born November 15, 1993) is an American fine art photographer currently residing in
                    Orange, CA.
                    Visual artist and photographer Alex Stoddard focuses on the human form and the process of infusing
                    it
                    with natural surroundings. He also strives to create whimsical and surreal portraits. In our
                    interview
                    with Alex, we talk about doing a 365 project when he was only 16 and how it impacted his life and
                    art.
                </p>

                <p class="right">
                    Alex spent much of his early life alone exploring the woods behind his family home. He considers
                    this
                    isolation as well as the influence of social media to be major factors in his decision to start
                    taking
                    selfportraits at the age of 16. He was inspired by the way he could use photography to escape his
                    mundane
                    life
                    by putting on costumes and posing as different characters in his made-up worlds.
                    The blank canvas of the human body and its connectedness to nature became a major factor in his
                    images.

                    Art has always been, first and foremost, a means of escape for me and those who view my work.
                    It is a distraction from reality, a literal building of a new world to live in, even if just for a
                    moment as someone scrolls by the picture on their social media feed.
                    The real world is grim, lacking in magic. My photography is meant to transport, in the same way that
                    a
                    movie or song invites the audience into a different little pocket of reality.

                <p class="left">
                    A dark surrealist aesthetic mixed with ideas taken from art history, the human form, or nature, is
                    Stoddard's signature.
                    With these simple compositions that frame meaningful themes, the artist manages to use
                    self-portraiture as a means to escape, drawing the viewer in with him to a dream-state:
                    “My photography is meant to transport, in the same way that a movie or song invites the audience
                    into a different little pocket of reality.”

                    In Yoshihiko Ueda's photographs, the subjects are mostly things we have actually seen. 
                    When capturing natural elements, he delicately portrays the surface, allowing the flow of light to be distinctly revealed. 
                    Even if the results do not turn out as expected, Yoshihiko advises not to be discouraged and to trust our instincts, continuing to follow the desired path. 
                    Through him, the message is conveyed that it is more important to consistently and steadily pursue the desired path rather than focusing solely on the end result.
